# Node

-Going to use the "ExpressJS library" to smooth out the whole backend process, which is nice - better than buildign a whole server stack by hand.

- remember npm init
- npm install nodemon --save-dev sets up a dev dependencu od nodemon (monitoring to keep the server updating by updating the "scripts" in the package.json)
- by using "start" as the script, npm start just does it's thing.
