# Ipad Branch

So, I set up a. Separate branch and folder for work on the ipad, just because it has a high chance of being work that I don't manage to merge in a timely fashion.  Technically, not a big deal, but I think it will also be good branch and merge practice. 

Main issue is seeing if I can push a remote branch out of working copy.  If not, I can sort it out from the laptop, but it's I point of curiosity.
